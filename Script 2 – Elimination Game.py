# For the elimination_round function I wanted it to take in a list of players
# and the number of players to eliminate
# Depending on how many users the player wants to eliminate it will choose a random number each time
# It will eliminate the player associated with the index
# When this is done then the clock function will run

# In the function countdown_clock it displays a countdown timer for number of seconds depending on the parameter
# It takes in a number and will print this number counting down until it reaches 0
# After printing each second it pauses for 1 second to simulate a ticking clock.

# I have listed my sources as I referenced them throughout my code.
